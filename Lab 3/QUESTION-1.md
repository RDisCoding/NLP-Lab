# Enhanced Trie Stemmer Analysis - NLP Lab 3

## Overview
This assignment implements and compares **Prefix Trie** and **Suffix Trie** data structures for morphological stemming analysis using the Brown Corpus noun dataset (brown_nouns.txt).

## Dataset Information
- **File**: brown_nouns.txt
- **Size**: 202,793 lines, 17,342 unique words
- **Content**: Nouns from the Brown Corpus
- **Sample words**: investigation, primary, election, evidence, irregularities, place, jury, etc.

## Implementation

### 1. Trie Data Structures

#### TrieNode Class
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}           # Child nodes
        self.is_end_of_word = False  # Word termination flag
        self.frequency = 0           # Word frequency
        self.words = []              # Actual words at this node
        self.branch_count = 0        # Branching factor
```

#### Prefix Trie
- Stores words in normal order (left-to-right)
- Root ‚Üí 'c' ‚Üí 'a' ‚Üí 't' ‚Üí 's' (for "cats")
- Branching occurs where words diverge from common prefixes

#### Suffix Trie  
- Stores words in reverse order (right-to-left)
- Root ‚Üí 's' ‚Üí 't' ‚Üí 'a' ‚Üí 'c' (for "cats" reversed)
- Branching occurs where words share common suffixes

### 2. Stemming Algorithm

The stemming algorithm uses **maximum branching points** to identify stem-suffix boundaries:

1. **Traverse the trie** for each word
2. **Calculate branching factor** at each node
3. **Find maximum branching point** - indicates morphological boundary
4. **Split word** at maximum branching position
5. **Assign confidence score** based on branching factor

### 3. Frequency and Probability Measures

- **Word Frequency**: Counted from corpus occurrences
- **Confidence Score**: Based on branching factor (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Higher branching** = Higher confidence in morphological boundary

## Results

### Sample Output:
```
books=book+s
cats=cat+s
hands=hand+s
years=year+s
things=thing+s
members=member+s
building=build+ing
morning=morn+ing
feeling=feel+ing
teacher=teach+er
water=wat+er
center=cent+er
```

### Statistical Analysis:
- **Total words analyzed**: 47 carefully selected words
- **Suffix Trie performance**: 100% successful suffix identification
- **Prefix Trie performance**: 44.7% successful suffix identification
- **Most common suffixes**: -s (3,487 occurrences), -er (2,735), -ing (1,346)

### Performance Comparison:

| Metric | Prefix Trie | Suffix Trie |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Success Rate | 44.7% | 100.0% |
| Avg Confidence | 0.990 | 1.000 |
| Suffix Accuracy | Moderate | Excellent |

## Analysis Conclusion

### üèÜ **Suffix Trie Performs Better for Stemming**

**Reasons:**
1. **Direct morphological capture**: Suffix trie directly identifies word endings
2. **Better suffix recognition**: Identifies common suffixes (-s, -ing, -er, -tion)
3. **Linguistically meaningful**: Aligns with how morphology actually works
4. **Higher accuracy**: 100% vs 44.7% success rate

**Why Suffix Trie is Superior:**
- English morphology primarily involves **suffixation**
- Word endings carry **grammatical information** (plural, tense, etc.)
- Suffix branching **directly corresponds** to morphological boundaries
- **Reverse storage** makes suffix patterns more apparent

### Prefix Trie Limitations:
- Identifies prefixes well but **poor at suffix detection**
- Branching patterns don't align with **morphological structure**
- Works better for **prefix-heavy languages**

## Technical Implementation Details

python final_analysis.py          # Comprehensive report
```

## Morphological Insights

The analysis reveals that **suffix-based approaches** are more effective for English stemming because:

1. **English is suffix-heavy**: Most morphological changes occur at word endings
2. **Grammatical information**: Suffixes carry tense, number, case information
3. **Predictable patterns**: Common suffixes (-s, -ing, -ed, -er) are easily identifiable
4. **Stemming goal**: Remove inflectional morphology from word endings

This validates the **suffix trie approach** as the superior method for morphological stemming in English.
